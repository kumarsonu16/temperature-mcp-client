# What’s happening here:

# Process Management: Tracks all launched server processes for proper cleanup
# Health Checking: Verifies the server is responding before returning success
# Graceful Shutdown: Attempts SIGTERM first, then SIGKILL if needed
# Timeout Handling: Prevents hanging during server startup
# HTTP Status Validation: Recognizes the MCP server’s expected 406 response as healthy
